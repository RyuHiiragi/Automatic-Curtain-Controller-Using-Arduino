# Automatic-Curtain-Controller-Using-Arduino
This guide will walk you through building an automatic curtain controller using an Arduino and a servo motor. The system opens or closes the curtains based on the intensity of light detected by a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) . This project is ideal for automating home environments, improving energy efficiency, and enhancing convenience.
